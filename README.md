# ZenRouter 🧘

**The Flutter router that unifies Navigator 1.0 and 2.0 into one elegant system.**

ZenRouter bridges the gap between imperative navigation (Navigator 1.0) and declarative navigation (Navigator 2.0). Start with simple, imperative routing using `NavigationPath`, then optionally add the `Coordinator` pattern to make your app web-ready with deep linking support.

## Why ZenRouter?

🎯 **One System, Two Modes** - Use imperative routing for simplicity, or add declarative routing for web support  
✨ **Progressive Enhancement** - Start simple with NavigationPath, add Coordinator when you need it  
🔄 **Type-Safe** - Full type safety with compile-time route checking  
🛡️ **Powerful Guards** - Prevent unwanted navigation with async guards  
🔗 **Deep Linking Ready** - Built-in URI parsing and web navigation support  
📦 **Minimal Boilerplate** - Clean mixin-based architecture
